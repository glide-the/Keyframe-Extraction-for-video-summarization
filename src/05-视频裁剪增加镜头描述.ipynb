      "6.0: 'In the heart of a dimly lit room, an oval-shaped window frames a surreal landscape. The window, with its smooth, curved edges, allows a glimpse into a world that defies the laws of physics. Through the window, one can see three distinct tree-like structures, each with its own unique characteristics. The tree on the left, with its twisted and gnarled branches, seems to be reaching out as if trying to grasp something unseen. The middle tree, with its straight and sturdy trunk, stands tall and unyielding. The tree on the right, with its irregular branches, appears to be in a state of constant flux, as if caught in a perpetual state of growth and decay. The ground beneath these trees is a patchwork of sand and rocks, adding to the otherworldly feel of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of mystery and intrigue, inviting the viewer to imagine what lies beyond the window.'\n",

The room, cluttered with stacks of cheese wheels, papers, and books, suggests a hidden storeroom or secret hideout. A green chest in the background adds to the playful chaos. At 6 seconds, the scene shifts to a cavernous space where a small, pinkish-gray mouse sits comfortably on a sandy floor, ears perked, exuding contentment. The rough cave walls with holes and crevices create a sense of quiet solitude, contrasting the initial tension-filled setting with Tom poised for action and Jerry's fate hanging in the balance.\n",

      "caption_summary_text:A whimsical, hand-drawn animation style reminiscent of early 20th-century cartoons opens with a small, anthropomorphic mouse standing on a cloud in a sky filled with fluffy white clouds against a deep blue backdrop. The mouse, with large expressive eyes and oversized ears, lifts one leg as if to step, its tail curled playfully. At 6 seconds, the mouse, now in a ballet outfit, appears to float or jump in the air with arms outstretched and legs bent, expressing pure joy. The background transitions to a stylized cloudy sky in soft shades of blue and orange, enhancing the dreamlike, lighthearted atmosphere.\n",
